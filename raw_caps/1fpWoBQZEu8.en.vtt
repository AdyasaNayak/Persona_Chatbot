What I enjoyed the most was
 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.710 align:start position:0%
What I enjoyed the most was
teaching <00:03:45.000><c>Python </c><00:03:46.360><c>and</c>

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 align:start position:0%

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.070 align:start position:0%
teaching Python and
while <00:03:47.034><c>studying, </c><00:03:47.348><c>I </c><00:03:47.662><c>had </c><00:03:47.976><c>prepared </c><00:03:48.290><c>myself </c><00:03:48.604><c>in </c><00:03:48.918><c>C++</c>

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 align:start position:0%
while studying, I had prepared myself in C++
 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.030 align:start position:0%
while studying, I had prepared myself in C++
because <00:03:49.379><c>I </c><00:03:49.678><c>was </c><00:03:49.977><c>coming </c><00:03:50.276><c>from </c><00:03:50.575><c>assembly </c><00:03:50.874><c>language.</c>

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 align:start position:0%
because I was coming from assembly language.
 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.110 align:start position:0%
because I was coming from assembly language.
I <00:03:51.999><c>felt </c><00:03:52.958><c>that</c>

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 align:start position:0%
I felt that
 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.429 align:start position:0%
I felt that
this <00:03:53.308><c>language </c><00:03:53.496><c>is </c><00:03:53.684><c>much </c><00:03:53.872><c>better </c><00:03:54.060><c>than </c><00:03:54.248><c>assembly. </c><00:03:54.436><c>So,</c>

00:03:55.429 --> 00:03:55.439 align:start position:0%
this language is much better than assembly. So,
 

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:57.550 align:start position:0%
this language is much better than assembly. So,
that's <00:03:55.656><c>why </c><00:03:55.873><c>I </c><00:03:56.090><c>did </c><00:03:56.307><c>it </c><00:03:56.524><c>in </c><00:03:56.741><c>C++ </c><00:03:56.958><c>at </c><00:03:57.175><c>that </c><00:03:57.392><c>time</c>

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 align:start position:0%
that's why I did it in C++ at that time
 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.190 align:start position:0%
that's why I did it in C++ at that time
and <00:03:57.779><c>we </c><00:03:57.998><c>will </c><00:03:58.217><c>discuss </c><00:03:58.436><c>more </c><00:03:58.655><c>about </c><00:03:58.874><c>it </c><00:03:59.093><c>as </c><00:03:59.312><c>well.</c>

can also create your own customized structures. For example, there
 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.469 align:start position:0%
can also create your own customized structures. For example, there

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360 align:start position:0%
data structure
 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.909 align:start position:0%
data structure
keeps <00:05:18.458><c>track </c><00:05:18.556><c>of </c><00:05:18.654><c>a </c><00:05:18.752><c>previous </c><00:05:18.850><c>value. </c><00:05:18.948><c>It </c><00:05:19.046><c>also </c><00:05:19.144><c>keeps </c><00:05:19.242><c>track </c><00:05:19.340><c>of </c><00:05:19.438><c>a </c><00:05:19.536><c>next </c><00:05:19.634><c>value.</c>

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:19.919 align:start position:0%
keeps track of a previous value. It also keeps track of a next value.
 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:21.629 align:start position:0%
keeps track of a previous value. It also keeps track of a next value.
Now

00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:21.639 align:start position:0%
Now
 

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:23.230 align:start position:0%
Now
we <00:05:21.814><c>have </c><00:05:21.989><c>created </c><00:05:22.164><c>previous </c><00:05:22.339><c>and </c><00:05:22.514><c>next </c><00:05:22.689><c>just </c><00:05:22.864><c>for </c><00:05:23.039><c>understanding.</c>

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:23.240 align:start position:0%
we have created previous and next just for understanding.
 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.909 align:start position:0%
we have created previous and next just for understanding.
Basically, <00:05:24.840><c>it</c>

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:24.919 align:start position:0%
Basically, it
 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:26.710 align:start position:0%
Basically, it
keeps <00:05:25.134><c>track </c><00:05:25.349><c>of </c><00:05:25.564><c>two </c><00:05:25.779><c>values. </c><00:05:25.994><c>In </c><00:05:26.209><c>this </c><00:05:26.424><c>way, </c><00:05:26.639><c>it</c>

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:26.720 align:start position:0%
keeps track of two values. In this way, it
 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.110 align:start position:0%
keeps track of two values. In this way, it
can <00:05:26.909><c>also </c><00:05:27.098><c>keep </c><00:05:27.287><c>track </c><00:05:27.476><c>of </c><00:05:27.665><c>six </c><00:05:27.854><c>values. </c><00:05:28.043><c>So </c><00:05:28.232><c>these </c><00:05:28.421><c>are </c><00:05:28.610><c>your </c><00:05:28.799><c>data</c>

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.120 align:start position:0%
can also keep track of six values. So these are your data
 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.230 align:start position:0%
can also keep track of six values. So these are your data
structures. <00:05:29.453><c>There </c><00:05:29.786><c>are </c><00:05:30.119><c>some </c><00:05:30.452><c>common </c><00:05:30.785><c>data </c><00:05:31.118><c>structures</c>

keep the screenshot, if everyone has to
 

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:32.710 align:start position:0%
keep the screenshot, if everyone has to
